📚 String Calculator Kata Rules (Examples)
"" returns 0
"1" returns 1
"1,2" returns 3
New lines allowed between numbers
Support different delimiters: For example, "//;\n1;2" where
the delimiter is ";" should return 3.
Negative numbers throw an error: 
If there are multiple negative numbers, show all of them in the exception
message, separated by commas
